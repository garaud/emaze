# TODO

* Is it worth to use (vector) to store the coordinates or the cell-hash-table
  e.g. `(vector (vector 1 2 3) (vector 3 4 5) (vector 6 7 8))`. It will be
  possible to have a constant-time access to the cells?

* begin to implement the first and simple mazes generator algorithm: the binary
  tree algorithm
